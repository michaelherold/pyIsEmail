        # -----------------------
        # TLD addresses are specifically allowed in RFC 5321 but they are
        # unusual to say the least. We will allocate a separate
        # status to these addresses on the basis that they are more likely
        # to be typos than genuine addresses (unless we've already
        # established that the domain does have an MX record)
        #
        # http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5321#section-2.3.5
        #   In the case of a top-level domain used by itself in an address, a
        #   single string is used without any dots. This makes the requirement,
        #   described in more detail below, that only fully-qualified domain
        #   names appear in SMTP transactions on the public Internet,
        #   particularly important where top-level domains are involved.
        #
        # TLD format
        # ----------
        # The format of TLDs has changed a number of times. The standards
        # used by IANA have been largely ignored by ICANN, leading to
        # confusion over the standards being followed. These are not defined
        # anywhere, except as a general component of a DNS host name (a label).
        # However, this could potentially lead to 123.123.123.123 being a
        # valid DNS name (rather than an IP address) and thereby creating
        # an ambiguity. The most authoritative statement on TLD formats that
        # the author can find is in a (rejected!) erratum to RFC 1123
        # submitted by John Klensin, the author of RFC 5321:
        #
        # http://www.rfc-editor.org/errata_search.php?rfc=1123&eid=1353
        #   However, a valid host name can never have the dotted-decimal
        #   form #.#.#.#, since this change does not permit the highest-level
        #   component label to start with a digit even if it is not
        #   all-numeric.
